// React State
 
// ğŸ’¡ Props are passed to the component, while state is managed within the component.

// ğŸ’¡ State can be accessed using the useState hook in functional components and this.state in class components.

// ğŸ’¡ State is an object that influences what is rendered in the browser and can be changed within the component.

// ğŸ’¡ The setState method is used to alter the state of a class component.

// ğŸ’¡ State is privately maintained inside a component and can be used to influence the user interface.


// React Props :

// Props are nothing but optional inputs for components and returns the jsx as an ouput.
// Props are optional input for components, allowing for dynamic rendering.
// ğŸ’¡ Props are accessed and used in functional components using the props parameter and in class components using this.props.
// ğŸ’¡ Props are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed once set.
// ğŸ’¡ To render dynamic content passed as props, use props.name or props.children.
// ğŸ’¡ Props are essential for maintaining component data that may change over time in a React application.
